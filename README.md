# PokeAPI

In this challenge we will practice fetching in react with the useEffect hook.

## Tasks

1. Use `useEffect` so that the "loadPokemon" function is executed
   on the initial app component render.

**Hint:** Don't forget the dependency array!

2. Add a button that renders the next 20 Pokemon when clicked. The result data of the API has a `next` attribute which holds the correct url for fetching the next page of pokemon. Maybe you can save the nextUrl and the fetchUrl in two states?
